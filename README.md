# XOR Neural Network

This project implements a simple neural network to solve the XOR problem using Python and NumPy. The network consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The neural network is trained using backpropagation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Bhim-Rao/Simple-Neural.git
cd simple-neural
```
Install the required packages:
```sh
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

To train and test the neural network, run:

```sh
python main.py
```
This should output: 
```yaml
Input: [0 0], Output: [0.4984385781118704]
Input: [0 1], Output: [0.5084337861718952]
Input: [1 0], Output: [0.4888554952924806]
Input: [1 1], Output: [0.4988496643606066]
```
