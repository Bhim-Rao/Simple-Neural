# XOR Neural Network

This project implements a simple neural network to solve the XOR problem using Python and NumPy. The network consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The neural network is trained using backpropagation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/xor-neural-network.git](https://github.com/Bhim-Rao/Simple-Neural.git)
cd simple-neural
```
Install the required packages:
```sh
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

To train and test the neural network, run:

```sh
python main.py
```
